# Hughes et al

The following contains the necessary code for reproducing select figures from the associated manuscript   
The [interactive notebook](https://github.com/j-berg/collaborations/blob/master/casey_collab/hughes_rnaseq.ipynb) contains the relevant code for reproducing the normalization and processing of the conA RNAseq time course data, as well as the code to reproduce figures relating to this data
